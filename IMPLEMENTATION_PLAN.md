# Implementation Plan: Task 20 - Write Unit Tests for All Services and Handlers

## Overview
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all services and handlers in the Tiris Backend project to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Staged Implementation

### Stage 1: Set up testing infrastructure and utilities
- **Status**: Completed
- **Tasks**:
  - ✅ Set up Go testing framework with testify/mock
  - ✅ Create test utilities and helpers for common operations
  - ✅ Set up test database fixtures and mock data
  - ✅ Create repository mocks for service testing
  - ✅ Set up test configuration management

### Stage 2: Write service layer unit tests
- **Status**: Pending  
- **Tasks**:
  - Test AuthService (login, OAuth, token refresh, logout)
  - Test UserService (CRUD operations, stats, validation)
  - Test ExchangeService (CRUD operations, validation, ownership)
  - Test SubAccountService (CRUD, balance updates, validation)
  - Test TransactionService (complex queries, filtering, pagination)
  - Test TradingLogService (CRUD, filtering, source validation)

### Stage 3: Write handler layer unit tests
- **Status**: Pending
- **Tasks**:
  - Test AuthHandler (all authentication endpoints)
  - Test UserHandler (user management endpoints)
  - Test ExchangeHandler (exchange management endpoints)
  - Test SubAccountHandler (sub-account management endpoints)
  - Test TransactionHandler (transaction query endpoints)
  - Test TradingLogHandler (trading log management endpoints)

### Stage 4: Write middleware and utility unit tests
- **Status**: Pending
- **Tasks**:
  - Test authentication middleware
  - Test rate limiting middleware
  - Test CORS and security middleware
  - Test metrics collection functionality
  - Test error handling and logging utilities

### Stage 5: Test coverage analysis and optimization
- **Status**: Pending
- **Tasks**:
  - Generate test coverage reports
  - Identify and cover edge cases
  - Add performance and stress tests
  - Optimize test execution speed
  - Document testing best practices

## Dependencies
- Go testing framework
- testify/assert and testify/mock packages
- Test database setup utilities
- Mock generation tools

## Success Criteria
- All services have >90% test coverage
- All handlers have comprehensive endpoint testing
- All edge cases and error conditions are tested
- Test suite runs efficiently (under 30 seconds)
- Clear test documentation and examples

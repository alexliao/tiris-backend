## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Sequential Dependencies:
- Tasks 1-6 must be completed before Phase 2
- Task 7 (JWT) required before Tasks 9-13 (API endpoints)
- Tasks 4-5 (Database) required before Tasks 9-15 (API + Events)
- Task 6 (NATS) required before Tasks 14-15 (Event processing)
- Tasks 20-21 (Testing) can run parallel to other phases
- Tasks 22-25 (Deployment) require core functionality complete

### Parallel Opportunities:
- Tasks 9-13 (API endpoints) can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 16-19 (Infrastructure) can be developed alongside API work
- Tasks 20-21 (Testing) can be written as features are completed
- Tasks 22-23 (Docker/CI) can be set up early for development

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
- **OAuth Integration (Task 8):** Complex external dependencies
- **NATS Event Processing (Tasks 14-15):** New technology integration
- **TimescaleDB Setup (Tasks 3-4):** Specialized database configuration
- **Production Deployment (Task 25):** High availability requirements

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Start with simple implementations and iterate
- Create comprehensive tests for complex integrations
- Use proven libraries and frameworks
- Have rollback procedures for deployments
